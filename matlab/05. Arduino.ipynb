    "There are many built-in functions in Matlab to facilitate complex programming steps with few lines of code. Using built-in functions can save many hours of programming but also increases the amount that you must learn to master the language. There are common Matlab functions and also additional functions that are available as toolboxes. Many of the functions are also implemented as classes that are collections of objects and functions. To receive help on any function, type `help` with the function name. This module reviews the `arduino` functions for reading and writing to the microcontroller."
