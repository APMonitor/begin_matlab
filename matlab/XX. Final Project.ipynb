    "A good place to start is to create high-level instructions (pseudo-code) on what you want the program to do. Next, start filling in those parts of the code and test each part as you go. The final test is for 10 minutes but use a shorter time (maybe 10 seconds) as you test your code. Good luck!\n",

    "**Objective**: Program the TCLab to maintain the temperature (T1) at 37Â°C by adjusting the heater (Q1). Display the heater level (Q1) with an LED indicator as the program is adjusting the temperature. Create a plot of the temperature and heater values over a 10 minute evaluation period.\n",
