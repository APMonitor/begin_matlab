    "Egg incubation is tricky business. To incubate a chicken egg you have to keep it at *just* the right temperature. One way to do this would be to constantly check the temperature and turn up or down the incubator heaters manually. This might work but you'd have to do that for almost a month straight! A much better way would be to automate the temperature control by having a computer check and adjust the temperatures. That is exactly what the Temperature Control Lab can do! The lab comes equipped with two heaters and two thermometers so it can auto-adjust to keep the temperature just right. In this course we will learn about programming as we build a Java program that can maintain a perfect egg-incubation temperature.\n",

    "Every programmer must have basic background knowledge before using the language in more complex projects. This tutorial steps through basic programming skills to build the more complex incubator temperature control. The introductory 12 exercises are designed to be completed in 2-3 hours (15-20 minutes each) but sections can be skipped if you already have the background knowledge.\n",

The `tclab.m` file will appear in the same folder where you are running `01. Overview.ipynb`. The source file `tclab.m` is from the [URL on GitHub](https://github.com/APMonitor/begin_matlab/blob/master/tclab.m) and may already be in your run directory. Matlab and Octave have different methods (`websave` or `urlwrite`) to retrieve an Internet file. We first `try` the Match function and then `catch` any errors by trying the Octave function."
